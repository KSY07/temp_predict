# 1 Introduction 

This section details the purpose and scope of the Reliability Prediction Procedure (RPP) and indicates changes from the previous issue (SR-332, Issue 3, January 2011). 

1.1 Purpose and Scope 

A prediction of reliability is an important element in the process of selecting equipment for use by telecommunications service providers and other buyers of electronic equipment. As used here, reliability is a measure of the frequency of equipment failures as a function of time. Reliability has a major impact on maintenance and repair costs and on the continuity of service. The purpose of this RPP is to document recommended methods for predicting device and unit hardware reliability. This procedure also documents a recommended method for predicting serial system hardware reliability. It contains instructions for suppliers to follow when providing predictions of their device, unit, or serial system reliability (hereinafter called “product” reliability). It also can be used directly by telecommunications service providers for product reliability evaluation. Device and unit failure rate predictions generated using this procedure are applicable for commercial electronic products whose physical design, manufacture, installation, and reliability assurance practices meet the appropriate Telcordia (or equivalent) generic and product-specific requirements. This procedure cannot be used directly to predict the reliability of a non-serial system. However, the unit reliability predictions resulting from the application of this procedure can be input into system reliability models for prediction of system-level hardware reliability parameters. Troubles caused by transient faults, software problems, procedural errors, or unexpected operating environments can have a significant impact on system-level reliability. Therefore, system hardware failures represent only a portion of the total system trouble rate. Currently, this procedure also includes some discussion of system-level operating and configuration information that may affect overall system reliability. The procedure directs the requesting organization to compile this information in cases where the unit-level reliability predictions are computed for input to a specific system reliability model. This system-level information is not directly necessary for computation of the unit-level reliability predictions, but these information requirements are not currently addressed in other Telcordia requirements documents (GRs) and, therefore, are included in this Special Report (SR). For publishing Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) or Failures per billion device hours (FIT) numbers, Telcordia recommends that the methodology and assumptions should be clearly stated (i.e., the referenced document and issue number, plus environmental and temperature assumptions, should be given). For example: Telcordia SR-332, Issue 4, operating temperature (40°C), electrical stress (50%), environmental factor (1.0), quality factor (1.0), and Upper Confidence Level (60%).

1.2 Changes 

The initial issues of SR-332 (and TR-332) were developed from Military Specification MIL-HDBK-217, Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment, with customizations included to better harmonize with communications applications and equipment. The subsequent issues of SR-332 were revised to incorporate (a) field return data for failed equipment, (b) life-testing data from participants (users and manufacturers) for components and assemblies, (c) new equipment components and design combinations of devices, and (d) feedback from reliability calculations and use of the software tool for network equipment reviews. The overall goal of SR-332 has remained to provide a consistent means to quantitatively compare the intrinsic reliability of different assemblies and combinations of communications components and units. This issue of the RPP includes the following changes: • The generic device failure rates in Section 8 have been revised based on new data for many components. For a few devices, the range of complexity covered by the procedures has been extended. In addition, new devices have been added. • The Environmental Factors in Section 9 have been revised based on field data and collective experience of the forum members. • Clarification and guidance have been added based on items raised by the forum participants as well as frequently asked questions raised by users of the document.

# 2 Reliability Predictions for Electronic Equipment 2.1 Purposes of Reliability Predictions 

Reliability predictions derived in accordance with this procedure serve the following purposes: • They help assess the effect of product reliability on the maintenance activity and on the quantity of spare units required for acceptable field performance of any particular system. For example, predictions of the frequency of unit level maintenance actions can be obtained. Reliability prediction can be used to size spare populations. • They provide necessary input to system-level reliability models. System-level reliability models can subsequently be used to predict, for example, the frequency of system outages in steady-state, the frequency of system outages during early life, expected downtime per year, and system availability. • They provide necessary input to unit and system-level Life Cycle Cost Analyses. Life cycle cost studies determine the cost of a product over its entire life. Therefore, it is necessary to know how often a unit will need to be replaced. Inputs to this process include unit and system failure rates. This input includes how often units and systems fail during the first year of operation as well as in later years. • They assist in deciding which product to purchase from a list of competing products. As a result, it is essential that reliability predictions be based on a common procedure. • They can be used to set factory test standards for products requiring a reliability test. Reliability predictions help determine how often the system should fail. • They are needed as input to the analysis of complex systems like switching systems and digital cross-connect systems. It is necessary to know how often different parts of the system are going to fail even for redundant components. • They can be used in design trade-off studies. For example, a supplier could look at a design with many simple devices and compare it to a design with fewer devices that are newer but more complex. The unit with fewer devices is usually more reliable. • They can also be used to set achievable in-service performance standards against which to judge actual performance and stimulate action.

2.2 Definitions 2.2.1 Equipment Definitions 

The RPP views electronic systems as hierarchical assemblies. Systems are constructed from units which, in turn, are constructed from devices. The methods presented in this report predict reliability at these three hierarchical levels: 1. Device : A basic component (or part) as listed in Section 8 of this document. 2. Unit : Any assembly of devices. This may include, but is not limited to, circuit packs, modules, plug-in units, racks, power supplies, and ancillary equipment. Unless otherwise dictated by maintenance considerations, a unit will usually be the lowest level of replaceable assemblies/devices. The RPP is aimed primarily at the reliability prediction of units. 3. Serial System : Any assembly of units for which the failure of any single unit will cause a failure of the system. 

2.2.2 Definition of a Failure 

The definition of a failure should be well understood by the user. This is a crucial element in predicting system reliability parameters. For non-complex equipment such as units and devices, the definition of a failure is usually clear. The RPP is directed toward unit-level failures caused by device hardware failures. The following are not included in failure rate predictions using these techniques: • Transient failures such as those from soft errors due to alpha particle and cosmic radiation effects • Manufacturing process-induced errors (e.g., solder joints, Printed Circuit Board [PCB] fabrication, wiring) • Software failures 1• Failures from procedural errors. Such failures may contribute to hardware returns or downtime. Predictions using the techniques in this document may be adjusted as needed to account for these failures if needed for a prediction of hardware return rates or system/network availability. Any number of causes, including transient faults, software failures, and procedural errors, can result in returned hardware that has no trouble or fault found during diagnostic testing. This situation may result from insufficient test coverage during manufacturing diagnostics or component vendor test escape that truly is a hardware intermittent failure. The amount of this contribution in excess of the SR-332 prediction that should be included in system availability and maintenance estimates 1. Failures due to software/firmware errors on programmable devices are not considered. However, the hardware failure rates of programmable devices are considered.

is left for the reliability analyst to consider based on historical comparisons of predicted failure rates versus actual field return rates. However, failures in systems with multiple functions may be harder to define. In complex equipment, it may be useful to distinguish between failures affecting maintenance or repair and those affecting service. For example, the failure of an LED is likely to cause a return, but may not cause a service outage. Consequently, LEDs should be included in the failure rate estimate when the estimate is used to determine return rates, but they could likely be disregarded if the estimate is used to determine service availability. Some complex, multi-function systems may have reliability objectives for individual functions or for various states of reduced service capability. For example, it is often desirable for multichannel systems to define the maximum number of channels that can be out before the system is considered failed, i.e., no longer providing acceptable service. For such systems, it may be necessary to develop reliability and availability models to address these additional objectives. Detailed guidelines for developing these models are outside the scope of this document. Please read Section 6 about System Reliability prediction. 

2.2.3 Definition of Failure Rate 

2.2.3.1 Life Cycle of Electronic Equipment 

The RPP focuses on predicting failure rates for electronic equipment. The RPP does not address other aspects of reliability such as downtime, availability, and impacts of failures. Failure rates are not constant throughout the life cycle of electronic equipment. Failure rates of electronic equipment follow a bathtub curve. As shown in Figure 2-1, a bathtub curve is divided into three time periods: 1. Early Life (or Infant Mortality) : The failure rate is high, but decreases rapidly. Time to failure is modeled as a Weibull distribution. The methods assume that this period is the first 10,000 hours of operation (slightly more than a year). 2. Steady-State : This period begins after Infant Mortality. Failures occur at a constant rate, referred to as the steady-state failure rate . That is, the time to failure follows an exponential distribution. The RPP assumes that electronic equipment is in this period approximately after its first year of operation. 3. Wear-Out : The failure rate increases rapidly. Usually, Wear-Out does not occur for electronic devices during the service life, which may be as many as 20 years. For this reason, the Wear-Out period is not considered in the RPP. Certain device types such as batteries, electrolytic capacitors, crystal oscillators, flash memory, fans and motors, hard disk drives, lasers, and other optical devices may have a limited lifetime. These devices are more likely to have their service lives constrained by Wear-Out. For these devices with a limited lifetime, the failure rate applies to the “steady-state” or useful life of the devices before the point in time where Wear-Out occurs. Special consideration should be given to such devices in the proper interpretation of their steady-state failure rates. Licensed Exclusively for Bizpeer Company Ltd.

Figure 2-1 Bathtub Curve 2.2.3.2 RPP Failure Rate Predictions 

With reference to these time periods, the RPP provides predictions of the following: • The Steady-State Failure Rate . The constant failure rate in the Steady-State Period. The Steady-State Failure Rate provides the information needed for long-term product performance. • The Early Life Factor 2. The average failure rate during the early life (10,000 hours) can be expressed as a multiple of the Steady-State Failure Rate. This multiple (called the Early Life Factor), together with the Steady-State Failure Rate, provides a measure of the number of failures expected in approximately the first year of operation. 

2.2.3.3 Factors Affecting Failure Rates 

Device failure rates vary as a function of operating conditions and production quality. The operating conditions modeled in the RPP are as follows: • Operating Temperature . The RPP uses a Temperature Factor to model the effect of temperature on failure rate. The value of this Factor is found in Section 9.1 and is based on the device operating temperature and the type of device. The value is normalized to a temperature of 40°C, which produces a Temperature Factor of 1.0 for all device types. When the actual device operating temperature differs significantly from the normalized temperature, the actual

device operating temperature (as defined below) may be used. The following are temperature definitions as related to the device operating temperature used to determine Temperature Factor. — Ambient Temperature (Ta) . Ambient temperature is the room temperature or outside air temperature when the unit is operating under normal conditions 3. GR-63-CORE, NEBS TM Requirements: Physical Protection, specifies a room ambient air temperature of 23°C (73°F) measured 1.5 m (59 in) above the floor and 400 mm (15.8 in) in front of the equipment. A 25°C ambient temperature may be used as the air intake to the equipment containing the unit. For outdoor natural convection cooled equipment, ambient temperature is defined as the outside air temperature (including the effects of solar loading) outside the unit based on the specific application. — Device Operating Temperature . Operating temperature for a device is the temperature inside the unit in which the device resides. This temperature is defined as the temperature 0.5 inch above the surface of the device. When temperature variations across the board are relatively constant (as in forced air cooled systems), the average board temperature may be used. Board temperature may be determined by temperature sensors, thermocouple measurements, computer simulations, or Infrared (IR) imaging. When temperatures across the board vary significantly (as in convection cooled equipment), device case temperatures should be used for the major high heat dissipating devices and the average board temperature for all other devices. • Usage Example: The normalized device operating temperature of 40°C assumes a 25°C ambient temperature plus a 15°C average board temperature rise due to local heat generation. — Case Temperatures (Tc) . Case temperature is the external device temperature measured outside the device’s case. The case temperature of major heat dissipating devices should be used to determine the operating temperature for these devices. • Usage Example: Thermal mapping of a power transistor shows an average case temperature of 70°C, with an average board temperature of 50°C for all other devices. — Junction Temperatures (Tj) . Junction Temperatures cannot be used directly with Table 9-1 to determine a Temperature Factor, since Table 9-1 is calibrated to device operating temperature or case temperature as defined above. Tj can only be used to determine failure rate when a device manufacturer provides a proven Junction Temperature-Failure Rate Model. • Electrical Stress . In the RPP, stress is the ratio of applied voltage (or power) to rated voltage (or power) expressed as a percentage. The RPP uses an Electrical Stress Factor as a quantitative expression for the effect of stress on failure rate. The values for this factor are found in Section 9.2 based on stress and the type of 3. “Normal conditions” refer to the operating conditions for which the reliability prediction is to apply. If the reliability predictions are used as input in a system-level reliability model, these will be the operating conditions for the product in that particular system.

device. The values in the table range from 0.1 to 10.6 when stress goes from 10% to 90% on the most sensitive devices. If the stress is unknown, the RPP assumes stress is 50%, which produces a factor value of 1 for all device types. • Quality. Device failure rates are improved by supplier efforts to ensure the quality of their devices. For predicting failure rates, the RPP uses four Quality Levels for suppliers. Section 9.3 provides descriptions of these Quality Levels as an aid in classifying supplier quality efforts. Each level is assigned a Quality Factor value πQ , which is used as a multiplier of the basic failure rate. Table 9-4 provides these Quality Factor values, which range from 0.8 (for Quality Level III, the highest level) to 6.0 (for Quality Level 0, the lowest level). • Environmental Condition . The RPP defines six environmental conditions in Section 9.4 . A separate prediction should be made for each environmental condition to which the equipment may be exposed. The RPP uses an Environment Factor as a quantitative expression for a condition’s effect on failure rate. The defined factors goes from 1 for a ground-based, fixed, controlled environment such as a central office, to 3 for airborne commercial. For a space-based commercial environment such as a commercial communication satellite, refer to MIL-STD-217 or other applicable standards. The factors considered so far all influence the steady-state failure rate for devices. Suppliers also use various screening procedures to reduce the first-year failure rate. Such procedures as temperature cycling, voltage stressing, and vibration are used to eliminate devices susceptible to failure in the first year before they are shipped and go in service. Of all such procedures, Telcordia has received sufficient documentation for inclusion in the RPP only for burn-in. In this report, “burn-in” is defined as any powered operation that fully simulates (with or without acceleration) normal use conditions. The RPP uses the temperature and the duration of burn-in for a device (as well as for its unit and system, if applicable) in the prediction of the Early Life Factor for the device’s failure rate. Accounting for burn-in reduces the estimated value of the Early Life Factor. The longer the burn-in and the higher the burn-in temperature, the more the Early Life Factor is reduced. Some suppliers have questioned the value of burn-in for mature product designs. Telcordia investigated the relevance of burn-in for mature product designs through a study that included three types of burn-in, as well as no burn-in. This study examined the trade-off of time saved in the manufacturing cycle versus the cost of any additional failure if burn-in is eliminated. This study concluded that for mature product designs it is not necessary to do a burn-in, and the savings of time and material without burn-in would reduce the cost of the mature product. For such mature product designs, an appropriate Early Life Factor may be determined from analysis of field data. Licensed Exclusively for Bizpeer Company Ltd.

2.3 Outline of Methods 

The RPP provides methods for estimating the failure rates of electronic equipment in the Early Life and Steady-State periods of the equipment life cycle. The methods do not cover the Wear-Out period of the life cycle; it is assumed that the equipment has not entered the Wear-Out phase of its life cycle. 

2.3.1 Flow of Early Life Failure Rate Calculations 

The RPP estimates the Early Life failure rate as the product of the Steady-State failure rate and the Early Life Factor for the equipment in question. Calculation of the Steady-State failure rate is reviewed in Section 2.3.2. The calculation of the Early Life Factor for a device is described in Section 4. As described in Section 5.4, the Early Life Factor for a unit is a weighted average of the Early Life Factors for the devices that compose it. 

2.3.2 Flow of Steady-State Failure Rate Calculations 

The RPP calculation of failure rate predictions flows up the hierarchy of equipment from device to unit to serial system. The failure rate estimate for a unit is based on the failure rate estimates of the devices that compose that unit. Similarly, the failure rate estimate for a serial system is based on the failure rate estimates of the units that compose that system. Thus, the predictions at the lower equipment level are used to feed predictions at the higher equipment level. At each level, a failure rate estimate is made using one of three methods: 

• Method I: The Black Box or Parts Count Method 

This method is the foundation of RPP estimates. It was originally modeled on the methods from MIL-HDBK-217F, Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment . At the device level, the method assumes that no reliability data is available on the device for which a prediction is to be made; the prediction is based on generic reliability parameters as presented in Section 8 . At the unit level, the method assumes that the prediction is based only on the estimates of the failure rates of the individual devices that compose it. This is the simplest and most commonly used method. These techniques are also needed to complete the calculations in the more complex methods incorporating laboratory data or field data. 

• Method II: The integration of laboratory data with the Black Box/Parts Count Method 

Laboratory data such as results from High Temperature Operating Life (HTOL) tests as per the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) and Reliability Demonstration Tests (RDTs) may be used to supplement the Black Box and Parts Count procedures. At the device level, these techniques allow the laboratory data to be integrated with the generic data presented in Section 8 .At the unit level, these techniques allow the laboratory data to be integrated with the failure rate estimates for the composing devices. The result is a prediction Licensed Exclusively for Bizpeer Company Ltd. SR-332 Reliability Predictions for Electronic Equipment Issue 4, March 2016 2–8 Enterprise License Restrictions. See restrictions on title page. Ericsson strictly prohibits the unauthorized distribution, download, or sale of this copyrighted material. 

that lies between one generated from Method I and one based only on the laboratory data. 

• Method III: The integration of field data with the Black Box/Parts Count Method 

If field tracking data on the units or devices are available, the Black Box and Parts Count procedures may be supplemented. At the device level, these techniques allow the field tracking data to be integrated with the generic data presented in Section 8 . At the unit level, these techniques allow the field tracking data to be integrated with the failure rate estimates for the composing devices. The result is a prediction that lies between one generated from Method I and one based only on the field tracking data. In order to distinguish the methods as they apply to different levels, Methods I, II, and III refer to those methods at the unit level, while Methods I-D, II-D, and III-D refer to those methods at the device level. Section 3 describes Methods I-D, II-D, and III-D for application to estimating failure rates of devices. Method II-D for devices is used when laboratory data for the device in question is available. Method III-D for devices is used when field data for the device in question is available. Method I-D for devices is used when neither field nor laboratory data is available for the device in question. Section 5 describes Methods I, II, and III for application to estimating failure rates of units. Method II for units is used when laboratory data for the unit in question is available. Method III for units is used when field data for the unit in question is available. Method I for units is used when neither field nor laboratory data is available for the unit in question. It is possible to apply all three methods in a failure rate estimate. For example, a unit may consist of three devices A, B, and C. Laboratory data exists for device A allowing the use of Method II-D in the estimate of device A’s failure rate. Field data exists for device B allowing the use of Method III-D in the estimate of device B’s failure rate. No laboratory or field data exists for device C, so Method I-D must be employed to estimate device C’s failure rate. Therefore, the failure rate estimate for this unit is based on device failure rates utilizing all three methods at the device level. In addition, laboratory or field data for the unit could exist, allowing the use of Methods II and III at the unit level as well. For this reason, an explanation of the various methods employed at each level in a failure rate estimate may be useful. 

2.3.3 Items and Factors Excluded from Failure Rate Calculations 

Wire, Cable, Solder Connections, Wire Wrap Connections, and Printed Wiring Boards: When unit failure rates are being predicted, wire, cable, solder connections, wire wrap connections, and printed wiring boards (but not attached devices and connector fingers) may be excluded. In the case of solder connections, wiring, and circuit boards, it is assumed that board assembly manufacturers control their manufacturing processes, including soldering, in accordance with requirements that result in negligible contribution to unit failure rates. 

Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS) : The generic failure rates provided in Section 8 are based on data obtained from both RoHS-Licensed Exclusively for Bizpeer Company Ltd. Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment SR-332 Reliability Predictions for Electronic Equipment 2–9 Enterprise License Restrictions. See restrictions on title page. Ericsson strictly prohibits the unauthorized distribution, download, or sale of this copyrighted material. 

compliant and non-RoHS-compliant devices. The data shows no difference based on RoHS compliance. 

Surface Mount Technology: RPP base failure rate predictions for surface mount devices are equal to the RPP predictions for the corresponding conventional versions. At this time, Telcordia has received no evidence indicating a significant difference in failure rates between conventional and surface mount devices, even though several manufacturers have indicated that surface mount devices appear to be more reliable. Separate failure rate predictions for surface mount devices may be included in future RPP issues if equipment suppliers or users contribute valid field reliability data or other evidence that indicates a significant difference. 

Non-Service-Affecting Equipment in Availability Analyses : When unit failure rate predictions are to be used as input into system reliability models, the requesting organization may also approve exclusion of devices whose failure will not cause an immediate loss of service, necessitate an immediate maintenance visit, or result in additional service disruption during later system maintenance activities. For example, failure of a particular device may not immediately affect service, but may affect the system recovery time given a subsequent outage. This may include devices provided for monitoring, alarm, or maintenance purposes (e.g., channel busy lamps or failure indicator lamps). 

2.3.4 Guidance for Device Types/Technologies Not in Section 8 

If a prediction requires failure rates for devices not addressed adequately in Section 8, the use of other data sources (e.g., test data or field data from suppliers or manufacturers) is encouraged. The Telcordia technical contact listed on page ii may be contacted about the need for including new devices in Section 8. In determining whether a device from a laboratory test or from the field is a suitable counterpart for the subject device, the similarity of the wafer process, device materials, assembly process, transistor structure, and external packaging should be considered. 

2.3.5 Statistical Considerations 

2.3.5.1 Upper Confidence Levels 

The failure rate estimates for devices and units described in Section 3 and Section 5, respectively, are mean estimates. These estimates do not account for the uncertainty and variability in the data used to generate the generic device failure rates in Section 8. If a more conservative estimate of failure rates is desired, such as between 60% and 90% Upper Confidence Levels (UCLs), then the procedure can be used. Such an estimate means that there is only a 100% - 60% = 40% chance, or a 100% - 90% = 10% chance, that the predicted failure rate underestimates the true failure rate. The higher the UCL level is, the more conservative the estimate and the greater the protection against underestimating the true failure rate. Licensed Exclusively for Bizpeer Company Ltd. SR-332 Reliability Predictions for Electronic Equipment Issue 4, March 2016 2–10 Enterprise License Restrictions. See restrictions on title page. Ericsson strictly prohibits the unauthorized distribution, download, or sale of this copyrighted material. 

Section 7 provides techniques to estimate the UCLs of failure rates based on the mean and standard deviation estimates produced by the techniques in Section 3 and Section 5. 

2.3.5.2 Alternate and Supplementary Methods 

Information provided in Section 8 is primarily based on field data. Field data is believed to be the most accurate source for failure rates. This does not preclude the use of additional sources of data that are technically sound. A key consideration to determine if the data source is technically sound is that the devices are operated in a similar manner as in the unit undergoing prediction. These sources could include a device manufacturer’s test data, or field data from a supplier or other source. Telcordia provides methods to incorporate this type of data into the SR-332 prediction. When incorporating vendor or laboratory test data, users must follow the Method II-D technique specified in Section 3.2. When incorporating field data, a user must follow the Method III-D techniques specified in Section 3.3. Both methods provide a blended value of the mean and standard deviation that weighs the strength of the supplemental data against the existing failure rate estimate given in Section 8. The use of these methods (Method II-D or III-D) in a prediction should be explicitly described when applied in making predictions. 

2.3.6 Automated Reliability Prediction Procedure (ARPP) 

Telcordia supports a Microsoft Excel-based software tool called FD-ARPP-01, 

Automated Reliability Prediction Procedure (ARPP), that performs the various calculations described in this document. Using the drop-down menu feature, the device category, subcategory, quality level, environment, and prediction method are selected. Operating temperature and electrical stress are entered at the unit level (which applies the same parameter to all devices), or may be entered at the device level for each individual device. Environmental factor and desired confidence level are entered at the unit level. Laboratory and field data may also be integrated into the prediction calculation for the entire unit or for each individual device. Output parameters include total unit failure rate (FITs) and Mean-Time-Between-Failure (MTBF) with both mean and Upper Confidence Level (UCL) values provided. The ARPP software tool is available as a companion to the SR-332 document when purchased. Licensed Exclusively for Bizpeer Company Ltd.

# 3 Steady State Failure Rate Prediction for Devices 

Depending on the amount of data available, the steady-state failure rate for device i can be predicted using one of three techniques: 1. Method I-D: Black Box 

This technique assumes that no data is available from the laboratory or the field. The prediction is based solely on generic data available in this document. 2. Method II-D: Black Box Integrated with Laboratory Data 

This technique assumes that relevant laboratory data on the device is available. The technique weights the laboratory data against the generic data to produce a refined prediction of the failure rate. 3. Method III-D: Black Box Integrated with Field Data 

This technique assumes that relevant field data on the device is available. The technique weights the field data against the generic data to produce a refined prediction of the failure rate. Note that all three techniques require a black box prediction of the failure rate. The additional data in the other two techniques are used to improve the accuracy of the prediction for a particular device. The techniques are used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the device steady-state failure rate, and , respectively. Note that the standard deviation of the device steady-state failure rate needs to be calculated only if an Upper Confidence Level (UCL) of the failure rate is to be calculated for a device or unit; otherwise, its calculation may be skipped. 

3.1 Method I-D: Black Box Technique 

The prediction of the steady-state failure rate for a device is based on a generic steady-state failure rate for the type of device. This generic value is then modified for quality, stress, and temperature. The mean black box steady-state failure rate, , is:

When there is no laboratory data or field data for the device available, the mean and standard deviation of the device steady-state failure rate, and ,respectively, are equal to the mean and standard deviation of the black box steady-state failure rate: and (3-3) 3.2 Method II-D: Techniques Integrating Laboratory Data 

Two techniques are available for using laboratory data to predict steady-state device failure rate. The technique to use depends on whether the devices in the laboratory test were burned-in or not. In either case, the mean and standard deviation of the device steady-state failure rate are, respectively, and (3-4) 

where n is the number of device failures in the laboratory test, and is the black box steady-state failure rate described in Section 3.1. The techniques differ only in the calculation of A. This prediction technique is based on “A Bayes Procedure for Combining Black Box Estimates and Laboratory Tests.” This method may be applied using laboratory data for a similar counterpart to the subject device of the prediction. In determining whether a device from a laboratory test is a suitable counterpart for the subject device, the similarity of the wafer process, device materials, assembly process, transistor structure, and external packaging should be considered.

3.3 Method III-D: Techniques Integrating Field Data 

Here the steady-state failure rate for device i is obtained as a weighted average of the black box steady-state failure rate and the field failure rate. The technique assumes that the black box steady-state failure rate is based on data that includes two failures. The subject is the device for which a failure rate prediction is being made. The 

tracked system is the hardware system for which field failure data exists. In order for this data to be applicable to a prediction of the subject failure rate, the tracked system must contain a counterpart device identical or similar to the subject. In determining whether such a device is a suitable counterpart for the subject device, the similarity of the wafer process, assembly process, transistor structure, and external packaging should be considered. The user of this method must ensure that the necessary processes and controls are in place to accurately account for all field failures. Field data from device vendors may be inadequate because they usually have limited visibility on how their devices are used and what processes are in place for return and repair. In addition: • The quality level (see Table 9-4) of the subject must be equal to or better than the quality levels of the devices in the tracked systems. • The environmental level of the subject must be the same or less severe than the environmental level of the tracked system. • The field tracking study must cover an elapsed clock time of at least 3,000 hours. The mean and standard deviation of the subject device steady-state failure rate are, respectively, and (3-8)

These elements of the equation are described in more detail in the following subsections. 

3.3.1 Total Operating Hours 

Total operating hours is the total exposure of the subject’s counterpart as tracked in the field. Suppose these systems have been tracked for T system-hours. If each system contains N U units, each containing N D counterpart devices comparable to the subject device, then t = N D x NU x T.To use this technique, the total operating hours must be sufficiently long to provide a reasonable opportunity for at least two failures to have occurred. In order to assure this, either • The number of field failures f must be greater than or equal to two OR • The following inequality must be satisfied: where is the black box failure rate prediction and is the Environment Factor for the subject’s counterpart in the tracked system. Note that if the subject and its counterpart are identical, then = .

3.3.2 Adjustment Factor (V) 

If the subject and its counterpart in the tracked system are identical and used under the same temperature and electrical stress conditions, then no adjustment is needed (V = 1).

3.4 Examples 

This section contains an example calculation for each of the three cases. All of the examples assume that a reliability prediction is needed for device A65BC, a digital bipolar non-hermetic integrated circuit with 30 gates. Quality Level II is assumed. The device will operate at 45°C at 50% electrical stress. 

3.4.1 Example 1: Method I-D, Black Box Technique 

The technique requires the following elements: • = generic mean steady-state failure rate . Table 8-7 shows that a digital bipolar integrated circuit with 30 gates has a generic mean failure rate of 1.2 FITs. • = standard deviation of generic steady-state failure rate . Table 8-7 shows that the standard deviation of the generic mean failure rate of this device is 0.5 FITs. • = Quality Factor . Table 9-4 indicates that Quality Level II has a Quality Factor of 1. • = Electrical Stress Factor . Section 8.5 specifies that the Electrical Stress Factor equals 1 for integrated circuits. • = Temperature Factor . Table 8-6 specifies that Curve 6 in Table 9-1 should be used to determine temperature stress for digital bipolar integrated circuits with 30 gates. Based on the operating temperature of 45°C, this curve gives a Temperature Factor of 1.2. To estimate the mean failure rate, the basic equation used is Equation 3-1 in Section 3.1: = 1.44 FITS. The estimate of the standard deviation of the failure rate is based on Equation 3-2 in Section 3.1: = 0.6 FITS. This technique assumes that no data from laboratory testing or field tracking studies is available. The prediction of the device’s failure rate is based entirely on generic data contained in this report. So, = 1.44 FITS and = 0.6 FITS.

3.4.2 Example 2: Method II-D, Integrating Laboratory Test Data 

Assume that N0 = 2,000 A65BC devices are tested at 100°C for T a = 1,000 hours, resulting in n = 4 failures of device A65BC. The effective time on test is: 

T1 = T a × A L = 1,000 × 11= 11,000 hours, where the acceleration factor ( A L) comes from Table 9-1, Curve 7, based on the 100°C test temperature. 

3.4.2.1 Example 2a: No Burn-In of Laboratory Test Devices 

Since T1 > 10,000 hours, then Equation 3-6 is used for A: Using Equation 3-4, and .Note that the laboratory test data has increased the predicted unit failure rate compared to the black box prediction based solely on industry-wide data in this report. 

3.4.2.2 Example 2b: Previous Burn-In of Laboratory Test Devices 

Using Equation 3-7: Only W is needed to complete the calculation of A. The value of W reflects the burn-in of the laboratory test devices. Assume that laboratory test devices have 

tb,d = 168 hours of device burn-in at 150°C. Based on this temperature, A b,d = 47 using Curve 7 of Table 9-1. To calculate W, first calculate total effective burn-in time for laboratory test devices: 

T e = A b,d tb,d = 47 × 168 = 7,896 hours.

Adding this to T1 = 11,000 hours, we get T1 + T e = 18,896 hours. Since T1 + T e > 10,000 ≥ T e, then 

W = ((T 1 + T e )/ 4,000) + 7.5 – T e0.25 = (18,896/4,000) + 7.5 – 7,896 0.25 = 2.80. Therefore, using Equation 3-4, and .Note that the prediction of the steady-state failure rate is higher if laboratory test devices had burn-in prior to testing. Devices with burn-in are not expected to fail as often as the same devices with no burn-in.

Assume that field data exists for the unit for t = 10 8 total operating hours in a ground fixed, uncontrolled environment ( = 2). During the study, f = 8 failures were observed. Using Equation 3-9, .Using Equation 3-8, and .The steady-state failure rate prediction depends on the similarities between the subject and its counterpart in the field systems as reflected by the adjustment factor

# 4 Early Life Factor Prediction for Devices 

The Early Life Factor for a device is the ratio of its early life failure rate to its steady-state failure rate. Two techniques are used to estimate the Early Life Factor for a device, depending on the amount of burn-in. Burn-in may be performed on the device alone, a unit containing the device, and a system containing the device. 

4.1 Early Life Factor for Device with Limited or No Burn-In 

When burn-in is less than or equal to 1 hour, the Early Life Factor is determined by the Temperature Factor ( from Table 9-1) and Electrical Stress Factor ( from Table 9-2) under normal operating conditions: • If 1.14 ≥ , then . (4-1) 

• Otherwise, . (4-2) 4.2 Early Life Factor for Device with Extensive Burn-In 

The computation of the device Early Life Factor is a two-step process: • Step 1 : Calculate the device equivalent operating time from burn-in .• Step 2 : Calculate the device Early Life Factor based on the equivalent operating time, the electrical stress, and the normal operating temperature. 

4.2.1 Equivalent Operating Time for Burn-in

4.3.2 Example 2: Extensive Burn-In 

Assume that the device has had 168 hours of device burn-in at 150°C, 72 hours of unit burn-in at 70°C, and no system burn-in. According to these assumptions, the following are the values for the burn-in parameters: • Device burn-in time t b,d = 168 • Device Arrhenius acceleration factor A b,d = 47 (corresponding to the device burn-in temperature of 150°C in Table 9-1, Curve 7) • Unit burn-in time tb,u = 72 • Unit Arrhenius acceleration factor A b,u = 3.7 (corresponding to the unit burn-in temperature of 70°C in Table 9-1, Curve 7) • System burn-in time t b,s = 0 • Temperature acceleration factor A op = 1.3 (corresponding to the operating temperature of 45°C in Table 9-1, Curve 7). The first step is to calculate the equivalent operating time for burn-in: Since X = = 6,279 x 1.2 x 1 = 7,535 < 10,000 and Y = X + 8760 x = 7,535 + 8,760 x 1.2 x 1 = 18,047 > 10,000 then, using Equation 4-5, Note that the burn-in reduced the Early Life Factor so that the early life failure rate is only slightly higher than the steady-state failure rate.

# 5 Failure Rate Prediction for Units 

The failure rate prediction for a unit is based on the failure rates predicted for its device components. This prediction technique is commonly known as the “Parts Count” method in which the mean unit failure rate is assumed to be equal to the sum of the device failure rates. If data from laboratory tests or field studies of units are available, they can be used to modify the Parts Count prediction. The techniques are used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the unit steady-state failure rate, and , respectively. Note that the standard deviation of the unit steady-state failure rate needs to be calculated only if an Upper Confidence Level of the failure rate is to be calculated for the unit; otherwise, its calculation may be skipped. 

## 5.1 Method I: Unit Steady-State Failure Rate Using the Parts Count Method 

The Parts Count prediction for a unit computes the mean steady-state failure rate λPC as the sum of the mean device steady-state failure rate predictions for all n device types in the unit 1, weighted by the quantity of each device type (N i) and by the unit Environment Factor πE.Specifically, the mean steady-state failure rate is 

(5-1) 

and the standard deviation 2 of the steady-state failure rate of the unit is . (5-2)

λSS σSS 

1. For this calculation, a device type is a particular product. So, if Unit A consists of N 1 devices of a product with Part Number X, N 2 devices of a product with Part Number Y, and N 3 devices of a product with Part Number Z, then n= 3. 2. This calculation assumes that the failure rate estimates for the various device types that make up the unit are statistically independent. In actuality, these estimates are likely to be correlated to some degree. Thus, the application of Equation 5-2 as described provides a lower bound for the actual standard deviation. In most situations, the difference between this lower bound and accounting for the correlation should be relatively small. However, the application of Equation 5-5 can be generalized to account for this correlation; if a more conservative standard deviation estimate is desired, the definition of a device type in the footnote above can be expanded to all devices in the unit using the same failure rate data from Section 8.

For a given device type i: • If all N i devices of type i in the unit have the same quality and are used under the same temperature and electrical stress conditions in the unit, then and (5-3) 

The default standard deviation associated with the group of like devices uses the multiplier of N i rather than the square root of N i because the devices have nearly identical characteristics and are expected to behave in the same manner, thus exhibiting a strong correlation.

5.2 Method II: Integrating Laboratory Test Data on Units 

Prediction of unit steady-state failure rate may be improved if data from units tested in the laboratory are available. Two techniques are available for using laboratory data to predict steady-state device failure rate. The technique to use depends on whether the units in the laboratory test were burned-in or not. In either case, the mean and standard deviation of the unit steady-state failure rate are, respectively, and (5-7) 

where n is the number of unit failures in the laboratory test. The techniques differ only in the calculation of A.This method may be applied using laboratory data for a similar counterpart to the subject unit of the prediction. In determining whether a unit from a laboratory test is a suitable counterpart for the subject unit, the similarity of the cooling design, assembly process, product functions, and potential failure modes/mechanisms should be considered. 

5.2.1 When Laboratory Test Units Have No Previous Unit/Device Burn-In 

When units are tested in the laboratory, the following formulas describe the calculation of the unit steady-state failure rate: • If T1 ≤ 10,000, then use the following value for A in Equation 5-7: 

(5-8) 

• If T1 > 10,000 hours, then use the following value for A in Equation 5-7:

If the temperature is unknown, use 1, which assumes 40°C. 

N0 = number of units on test. 

T1 = effective time on test in hours. The effective time on test is the product of the actual time on test ( T a) and the laboratory test temperature acceleration factor ( A L) from Table 9-1, Curve 7. A 2

5.2.2 When Laboratory Test Units Had Previous Burn-in 

When there is burn-in, prediction is more complicated. Use the following value for 

A in Equation 5-7: 

(5-10) 

where , , , and N 0 are defined as in the previous subsection. The time factor W is based on the effective time on test ( T 1 as described in the previous subsection) and on the total effective burn-in time for units ( Te): • If Te > 10,000, then 

W = T 1 / 4,000 • If T1 + T e ≤ 10,000, then 

W = (T 1 +T e )0.25 – T e0.25 • Otherwise, 

W = ((T 1 + T e )/ 4,000) + 7.5 – T e0.25 The total effective burn-in time for units tested in the laboratory ( T e) is 

Te = T *b,d + A b,u tb,u 

where 

T *b,d = average test device effective burn-in time. 

A b,u = temperature acceleration factor (from Table 9-1, Curve 7) corresponding to the test unit burn-in temperature.

5.3 Method III: Integrating Field Data on Units 

Here the steady-state failure rate for a unit is obtained as a weighted average of the Parts Count steady-state failure rate and the field failure rate. The technique assumes that the Parts Count steady-state failure rate is based on data that includes two failures. The subject is the unit for which a failure rate prediction is being made. The tracked system is the hardware system for which field failure data exists. For this data to be applicable to a prediction of the subject failure rate, the tracked system must contain a counterpart unit identical or similar to the subject. In determining whether such a unit is a suitable counterpart for the subject unit, the similarity of the cooling design, assembly process, product functions and potential failure modes/ mechanisms should be considered. The user must ensure that the necessary processes and controls are in place to accurately account for all field failures. Failed units from the field may be discarded without notifying the vendor, which could significantly overestimate the unit reliability. In addition: • The quality level (see Table 9-4) of the subject must be equal to or better than the quality levels of the units in the tracked systems. • The environmental level of the subject must be the same or less severe than the environmental level of the tracked system. • The field tracking study must cover an elapsed clock time of at least 3,000 hours. The mean and standard deviation of the subject unit steady-state failure rate are, respectively, and (5-11) 

where 

(5-12) 

and These elements of the equation are described in more detail in the following subsections. 

t = Total operating hours of the subject’s counterpart in the tracked systems 

f = Field failure count (number of failures of the subject’s counterpart observed in the tracked systems during the field tracking study) 

V = Factor to adjust for differences between the subject and its counterpart in the tracked systems = The Parts Count failure rate prediction for the subject unit.

5.3.1 Total Operating Hours 

Total operating hours is the total exposure of the subject’s counterpart as tracked in the field. Suppose that these systems have been tracked for T system-hours. If each system contains NU units, then t = NU x T.To use this technique, the total operating hours must be long enough to provide a reasonable opportunity for at least two failures to have occurred. In order to assure this, either • The number of field failures f must be greater than or equal to two OR • The following inequality must be satisfied: where is the Parts Count failure rate prediction for the subject’s counterpart in the tracked system. Note that if the subject and its counterpart are identical, then = .

5.3.2 Adjustment Factor (V) 

If the subject and its counterpart in the tracked system are identical, and the subject and tracked system are used under the same environment conditions (see Section 9.4), then no adjustment is needed ( V = 1). If the subject and its counterpart in the tracked system are identical, but the subject is used under environment conditions different than those for the tracked system, then V = , where and are the Environment Factors for the subject and its counterpart in the tracked system, respectively. If a) the subject and its counterpart in the tracked system are similar but not identical, and/or b) they are used in different temperature or electrical stress conditions, then V = /where and are the Parts Count failure rates for the subject and its counterpart in the tracked system, respectively (see Section 5.1). 2 x 10 9

5.4 Unit Early Life Factor 

A unit’s Early Life Factor is a weighted average of the Early Life Factors for its devices :

(5-13) 5.5 Sampling Method - Using Default Temperature and Stress Factors on a Sample of Units 

In cases where a large number of unit level predictions for a system are to be computed, providing Electrical Stress and Temperature Factors for each device in every unit level prediction may not be necessary. The question becomes on which units and for which devices can one assume the default Temperature and Electrical Stress factors. The following approach may be used: 1. Select a sample of ten unit designs that are representative of the system. Care must be used to avoid bias in the sample selection. This is particularly important when system-level parameters computed in a system reliability model are to be compared with the system-level parameters for a competing system. Use the following criteria: A. If any devices are burned-in, select ten unit designs that, on the whole, contain a proportion of these devices consistent with the proportion of burned-in devices in the system. B. Do not select unit designs for units that are subjected to unit-level burn-in. Predictions for these designs should be computed using the complete reliability prediction technique. C. Include unit designs that are used in large quantities in the system. D. Include unit designs that perform different functions, for example, power supplies and digital, analog, and memory units. 2. Perform a complete reliability prediction and calculate the Early Life Factor (πEL ) for each selected unit design. 3. Perform a default steady-state black box reliability prediction on all units using all default stress and Temperature Factors (excluding those in item 1B, above) and assuming no burn-in. That is, assume 50% stress and 40°C for all devices in the unit. 4. The average πEL value determined from the sample in item 2 is applied to all non-sampled unit designs (excluding those in item 1B, above). 5. The average ratio between the selected steady-state black box predictions and the default steady-state black box prediction should be applied to all non-sampled designs (excluding those in item 1B, above).

If the sample adequately represents the total system, this approach will provide a reasonably accurate prediction of early life and steady-state unit failure rates with less effort than performing a complete reliability prediction on every unit design. 

5.6 Examples 

This section contains an example calculation for each of the three cases for steady-state failure rate and for Early Life Factor. All of the examples assume that a reliability prediction has been requested for a product called APPARATUS. This product consists of a single unit (called EXAMPLE) having the following devices with mean failure rate predictions having standard deviations and Early Life Factors :

Note: The devices in this example have different Early Life Factors as a result of different degrees of device burn-in. Device Quality Level I is assumed for the capacitors and the LED, and Device Quality Level II is assumed for all other devices on the unit. All devices are assumed to be operating at 40°C and 50% electrical stress. A prediction is needed assuming a Ground, Fixed, Uncontrolled environment ( πE = 2) (see Table 9-5). All examples that follow (except Example 5) assume that all devices within a type have the same quality and are used under the same temperature and electrical stress conditions in the unit. Example 5 makes this assumption for all device types except Digital N-type Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (NMOS) Integrated Circuits (ICs) which have different operating temperatures.

5.6.3 Example 3: Method II, Integrating Laboratory Test Data 

Assume that the unit will be normally operated at 40°C; using Table 9-1 (Curve 7), this gives πT =1. Recall from Example 1 that the Parts Count prediction was 

λPC = 614 FITs. Assume 500 units are tested at 65°C for 1,000 hours, resulting in 3 failures. So, 

N 0 = 500, n = 3, and T a = 1,000. Based on a laboratory test temperature of 65°C, Table 9-1 (Curve 7) gives acceleration factor A L = 3.0. The effective time on test is: 

T1 = T a × AL = 1,000 × 3.0 = 3,000 hours 

5.6.3.1 Example 3a: No Previous Burn-In of Laboratory Test Units 

Since T1 ≤ 10,000, then Equation 5-8 is used to calculate A: .Using Equation 5-7 and .Note that the laboratory test data has reduced the predicted unit failure rate to about 60% of the Parts Count prediction based solely on industry-wide data in this report. 

5.6.3.2 Example 3b: Previous Burn-In of Laboratory Test Units 

Equation 5-10 is used to calculate A: = 0.00326 + W / 1000. Only W is needed to complete the calculation of A. The value of W reflects the burn-in of the laboratory test units. Assume that laboratory test units have no device burn-in ( T*b,d = 0), but do have t b,u = 1000 hours of unit burn-in at 70°C. Based on this temperature, we find that A b,u = 3.7 using Curve 7 of Table 9-1. To calculate W,first calculate total effective burn-in time for laboratory test units: 

Te = T*b,d + Ab,u tb,u = 0 + (3.7 × 1000) = 3,700 hours. Adding this to T 1 = 3,000 hours, we get T 1 + T e = 6,700 hours. Since T1 + T e ≤ 10,000, then 

W = 6700 0.25 – 3700 0.25 = 1.25.

So, A = 0.00326 + W/1000 = 0.00326 + 1.25/1000 = 0.00451. Using Equation 5-7 and .Note that this mean estimate is more than two times greater than the prediction based on laboratory test units with no burn-in.

# 6 System Reliability (Service Affecting Reliability Data) 

This section describes the computation of reliability predictions for serial systems. A serial system is a system for which the failure of any unit results in the failure of the entire system. This section also provides an introduction to what is needed for non-serial systems. 

6.1 Serial System Reliability 

This section describes the computation of reliability predictions for serial systems. 

6.1.1 Steady-State Failure Rate 

If the specified reliability parameters, failure criteria, equipment configuration, and operating conditions indicate that a serial reliability model is appropriate, the total system failure rate, λSYS , will be the sum of all the unit steady-state failure rates, λSS .That is, 

(6-1) 

where λSS(j) is the unit steady-state failure rate for unit j, and M is the number of units. The discussion in early subsections of Section 5 omitted the subscript j for simplicity because there was only one unit. Note that the unit steady-state failure rates are assumed to reflect only service-affecting failures. The standard deviation 

σSYS of the total system failure rate is . (6-2) 6.1.2 Early Life Factor

6.2 Non-Serial Systems 

Most complex communications systems do not conform to a serial reliability model. A serial system is one in which the failure of any unit results in the failure of the entire system. Typically, there may be some redundancy in the equipment so that the failure of some unit may not result in the loss of service for any customers. In addition, some failures may not affect all customers so that different levels of failures have to be considered. Finally, the requesting organization may be interested in items like system downtime or system availability. In these cases, a simple serial model is generally not appropriate. In these cases, a suitable reliability/ availability model must be developed. To develop a reliability/availability model, the following information is needed: • Steady-state failure rates for each of the units • Repair rates (or distribution of repair times) of each of the units • Description of the redundancy of each of the units • Number of repair people available • Any repair priorities • Travel time distributions to repair sites • Restoration times (including rebooting times) • Number and availability of spares • Alarms/failure detection capabilities • Probability of successfully switching over to the standby unit when the active unit fails • Description of manual and automatic diagnostic aids. This information should be provided along with the source of the information. For example, if there is data on the repair times for some piece of equipment, this information should be provided. Anyone developing a reliability model needs to prepare drawings, diagrams, or specifications to substantiate the reliability model. Since most reliability models require the use of some software, the person developing the model needs to provide the name of the software used in the development of the reliability model. To develop a representative reliability model requires the knowledge of a reliability engineer. A good reference on developing system reliability models is SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis . Another reliability engineering reference is Probabilistic Reliability: An Engineering Approach .More detail on the specification of reliability modeling techniques for complex systems is beyond the scope of this procedure.

# 7 Upper Confidence Levels for Failure Rates 

The failure rate estimates for devices and units described in Section 3 and Section 5, respectively, are mean estimates. These estimates do not account for the uncertainty and variability in the data used to generate the generic device failure rates in Section 8. If a more conservative estimate of failure rates is desired, such as between 60% and 90% Upper Confidence Levels (UCLs), then the procedure can be used. Such an estimate means that there is only a 100% - 60% = 40% chance, or a 100% - 90% = 10% chance, that the predicted failure rate underestimates the true failure rate. The higher the UCL level, the more conservative the estimate and the greater the protection against underestimating the true failure rate. This section presents techniques for estimating a UCL for a failure rate given the mean and standard deviation of the estimate as calculated using the techniques in Section 3 and Section 5. The techniques are described here for failure rate estimates of units; UCLs for device failure rates can also be calculated using these techniques by treating the device as a unit with one device. 

7.1 Upper Confidence Level Calculation 

The technique assumes that the failure rate follows a gamma distribution. Given the mean λ and standard deviation σ of the failure rate for the unit, the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution are: shape = ( λ / σ ) 2 (7-1) 

scale = σ 2 / λ (7-2)

7.2 Examples 7.2.1 Example 1: 90% Upper Confidence Level of the Steady-State Failure Rate 

The EXAMPLE unit described in Section 5.6.1 has the following parameter estimates: • Mean steady-state failure rate = 614 FITs • Standard deviation of steady-state failure rate = 392 FITs. Using Equation 7-1, the shape of the gamma distribution for failure rate of the EXAMPLE unit is shape = (614 / 392) 2 = 2.45 and, using Equation 7-2, the scale of the gamma distribution for failure rate of the EXAMPLE unit is scale = 392 2 / 614= 250 FITs. The 90% Upper Confidence Level for the steady-state failure rate is = G -1 (90/100, 2.45, 250) = 1137 FITs. 

7.2.2 Example 2: 90% Upper Confidence Level of the Early Life Failure Rate 

The Early Life Factor for the EXAMPLE unit is 1.11 as calculated in Section 5.6.2. Then the 90% Upper Confidence Level for the failure rate in the early life period is 1137 x 1.11 = 1262 FITs.

# 8 Device Parameter Values 

This section presents generic parameter values for a variety of devices that can be used in the estimation of failure rates. The tables used in this presentation may be copied and used as needed. The parameters describe generic failure rates plus the temperature and electrical stress curves that influence the estimation. The tables in this section give the mean point estimates of generic steady-state failure rates in FITs for a variety of devices. The tables also provide standard deviations in FITs for each device failure rate. The standard deviation is a reflection of the strength of the data supporting the mean failure rate estimate; the smaller the standard deviation is in proportion to the mean, the more accurate the estimate. The standard deviation values are only used if an upper confidence level for a failure rate is to be estimated. The failure rate means and standard deviations are rounded to two significant digits. The steady-state failure rates represent the device reliability before Wear-Out occurs (typically > 20 years). However, some devices such as electrolytic capacitors, crystal oscillators, flash memory, fans and motors, hard disk drives, lasers, and other optical devices may have a limited lifetime. For these devices with a limited lifetime, the failure rate applies to the “steady-state” or useful life of the devices before the point in time where Wear-Out occurs. The mean and standard deviation values given in this section represent failure rates assuming for the default conditions of 40 °C operating temperature, 50% electrical stress, Quality Level II, and G B environmental factor 1 (i.e., πT = 1.0, = 1.0, 

πQ = 1.0, and πE = 1.0). Parameters are provided to adjust these values to the actual stress conditions used in the design. These parameters cannot be used to determine the reliability of a component operating outside of the vendor’s rated specifications limits. In fact, the formulas may not fully account for the impact to reliability when components are used at or near the specification limits. Under these conditions, the component becomes more susceptible to the normal variations occurring during manufacturing and use. Therefore, the component failure rates provided in this section assume that designs will employ adequate derating of key stress parameters. Section 9 describes these factors and their impact on failure rates. Note that it is typically recommended that IC temperatures be derated from their maximum rated value. See ANSI/GEIA STD-0008, TechAmerica Standard Derating of Electronic Components , and other documents in Appendix B for further information on derating. For ICs with quality level less than QL II, additional derating may be required to account for the lower quality level of these devices. Devices with no temperature or electrical stress curves listed either have no impact from these effects, or the impact on their failure rates is not well understood. Users are invited to contact the Telcordia technical contact given on page ii with any references or sources to non-proprietary industry sources that can be used in a future update. The failure rates are based on data provided by several suppliers. New devices added and listed in the tables in this issue are in italics . Values in the tables and equations in Section 8 that have changed from Issue 3 are in bold . The remaining failure rates were not modified because no new data was available.

The tables do not include any failure rates for solder joints or bare circuit packs. The procedure assumes that board assembly manufacturers control their manufacturing processes (including soldering) in accordance with GR-357-CORE, Generic Requirements for Assuring the Reliability of Components Used in Telecommunications Equipment . Properly controlled soldering processes will result in negligible contribution to the board failure rate due to solder joint defects ( see Section 2.3.3).

8.5 Integrated Circuit Parameter Values 

This subsection describes failure rate parameter values for • Analog Integrated Circuits • Digital Integrated Circuits • Random Access Memory • Read Only Memory • Microprocessors • Microcontrollers • Hybrid Microcircuits • Gate Array and Program Array Logic. The generic failure rates apply to both conventional (through-hole) and surface mount technology (see Section 2.3.3). This section gives the generic steady-state failure rates of integrated circuit devices irrespective of whether the integrated circuits are packaged (i.e., encapsulated) or are bare chips (i.e., unencapsulated). The Electrical Stress Factor equals 1 for integrated circuits. Formulas in this section use “ln” for the natural logarithm function and “Exp” for the exponential function with base e.Failure rates are shown in the following tables as a function of device complexity (transistors, gates, bits, or bus width). For many devices, such as memory and microprocessor devices, the complexity value is provided on the device data sheet. However, data sheets for many analog and digital integrated circuits do not provide this information. Therefore, for the most accurate failure rate estimate, it is recommended that this information be obtained from the device manufacturer. The user should note that the failure rates are generally provided for a range of complexity values so that an exact gate or transistor count is rarely necessary. In addition, the error associated with being slightly off is typically small, especially as the device complexity increases. If the user is still unable to determine the correct complexity range, the notes section of the ARPP software tool provides generic complexity values for a number of common component families. However, the use of these generic complexity values may result in additional uncertainty with the resulting prediction.

8.5.5 Microprocessor 

Table 8-13 provides the failure rate parameters for microprocessor devices. The failure rates for microprocessor devices are a function of (a) technology (Bipolar, NMOS, and CMOS) and (b) device complexity (the number of gates for Bipolar and NMOS devices or bus width for CMOS devices). The number of gates is equal to the number of logical gates on the device schematic (including associated peripheral circuits). The mean and standard deviation of the failure rate given the technology and the device complexity are calculated from the equations given in Table 8-13. The Electrical Stress Factor equals 1 for microprocessors. 

Table 8-13 Microprocessor Failure Rate Parameters 

Table 8-14 lists failure rates for Bipolar and NMOS microprocessor devices, while Table 8-15 lists failure rates for CMOS microprocessor devices based on these equations.

8.7 Opto-Electronic Device Parameter Values 8.7.1 Fiber Optic Communication Devices and Modules 

In this document, a module is defined as a small packaged assembly that includes a laser diode/LED/detector and easy means for electrical connections and optical couplings. The failure rates assume that only hermetic fiber optic devices are used for the laser modules, LED modules, and detector modules. The use of non-hermetic or lower quality parts are expected to produce much higher failure rates than those predicted by using the device Quality Factors in Table 9-4. Unlike other devices, several fiber optic communication modules have separate failure rates for controlled and uncontrolled environments (see Table 9-5). These are in addition to the Environment Factor applied to the unit in which they reside. If the module contains other electronic devices or hybrids (such as a laser drive in the laser module and amplifiers in the detector module), additional failure rates should be added to the failure rates given here. Also, significant differences in failure rates of these devices are expected among different suppliers; this variability is not captured in the standard deviation of the failure rate. SR-TSY-001369, Introduction to Reliability of Laser Diodes and Modules, discusses reliability issues for laser modules. Table 8-17 lists parameter values for fiber optic communication devices and modules. The Electrical Stress Factor equals 1 for fiber optic communication devices and modules.

# 9 Failure Rate Factors 

This section defines and provides tables for factors that affect electronic equipment failure rates including Environment, Quality, Electrical Stress, and Temperature Factors. These tables may be copied and used as needed. 

9.1 Temperature Factor 

The failure rates provided in Section 8 assume an operating temperature of 40°C. If a device is in an environment that produces an operating temperature higher or lower than this base value, then the failure rate must be adjusted using the Temperature Factor as described in Section 3. The Temperature Factor is also used to calculate the effect of burn-in on infant mortality in Section 4. The Temperature Factor πT is derived by the following equation: 

(9-1) 

where 

T0 = reference temperature in °k = 40 + 273 = 313 

T1 = operating temperature in °k = operating temperature in °C + 273 

Ea = activation energy in eV k = Boltzmann constant = 8.62 x 10 -5 eV/°k The activation energy Ea is defined using the following table as a function of the temperature curve for the device type as specified in Section 8. Curve 7 has an additional special purpose. It is used to model temperature effects during Early Life and burn-in; a common curve is used for these purposes because many of the failure mechanisms during Early Life and burn-in are a result of manufacturing defects or weaknesses in devices for which the temperature effect is common across device types. The ambient temperature for the device is used as the operating temperature. When the ambient temperature above the devices does not vary more than a few degrees, a single temperature reading is considered adequate. In this case, the ambient temperatures of the devices and the unit containing these devices are taken to be the temperature obtained by placing a probe in the air ½ inch above the unit. If there is a wide variation in ambient temperature above the devices, it would be necessary to use special procedures not contained in this document. In such cases, a reliability analyst should be consulted. Table 9-1 provides Temperature Factors for various operating temperatures for each temperature curve. The table also defines the range of operating temperatures for which Equation 9-1 is considered valid. For temperatures above 65 ° C and below its operating limit, use Equation 9-1; Curve 7 is extended for temperatures up to 150 °Cfor assistance with burn-in and integration of laboratory test data. For temperatures below 30 ° C, use the Temperature Factor of 30 °C. Curve 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Ea (eV) 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.22 0.28 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.56 0.70

> *NOTE: Curve 7 (Ea = 0.40 eV) is extended for temperatures up to 150 oC for burn-in calculations.

9.2 Electrical Stress Factor 

The failure rates provided in Section 8 assume an electrical stress percentage of 50%. If a device’s application produces an electrical stress percentage higher or lower than this base value, then the failure rate must be adjusted using the Electrical Stress Factor as described in Section 3. 

9.2.1 Electrical Stress Curves 

Electrical Stress Factors vary as a function of the effect of electrical stress on the various types of devices and on the amount of stress encountered in any particular application. Section 8 describes the appropriate Electrical Stress Factor curve to use and how to calculate electrical stress for each type of device. If no curve letter is shown, the Electrical Stress Factor may be considered to be πS = 1. If a curve letter is shown, the Electrical Stress Factor πS is calculated using the following equation 

> (9-2)

where the parameter m defines the curve, p0 is the reference stress (50%), and p 1 is the stress percentage for the equipment in question. Curve K is the same as Curve A, except πS = 1 for stress p 1 < 50% . If two Electrical Stress Factors apply to a device, use the product of the two stress factors. Table 9-2 presents the appropriate parameter value of m for each curve letter and gives πS values for each curve at various stress levels.

Table 9-2 Electrical Stress Factors πS

9.2.2 Electrical Stress Percentage 

The stress percentage p1 is calculated by multiplying the ratio of applied voltage (or current or power) to the rated voltage (or current or power) by 100. “Rated” as used here refers to the maximum or minimum value specified by the manufacturer after any derating for temperature, etc. If the amount of stress varies during normal operation of the end product in which the device is used, use the average stress percentage. Section 8 describes how to calculate stress percentage for each applicable device type. The ratios for different types of devices are summarized in Table 9-3.

9.3 Quality Factor 

The device failure rates contained in this document reflect the expected field reliability performance of generic device types. The actual reliability of a specific device will vary as a function of the degree of effort and attention paid by an equipment manufacturer to factors such as device selection/application, supplier selection/control, electrical/mechanical design margins, equipment manufacture process control, and quality program requirements. Table 9-4 describes the four quality levels and presents values for their associated Quality Factors. The quality levels are not intended to characterize or quantify all of the factors that may influence device reliability. They provide an indication of the total effort an equipment manufacturer considers reasonable to expend to control these factors. These quality levels also reflect the scope and depth of the particular equipment manufacturer’s component engineering program. The Quality Level to be used for estimating the reliability of a given system can be determined by an analysis of the equipment manufacturer’s component engineering program and of its implementation throughout all stages of the product realization process. The criteria contained in GR-357-CORE can be used to guide such an analysis. Justification for the use of all quality levels other than Quality Level 0 should be provided. For more information on component reliability assurance practices, see GR-357-CORE and GR-2969-CORE, Generic Requirements for the Design and Manufacture of Short-Life, Information-Handling Products and Equipment .GR-357-CORE also includes discussion of alternative types of reliability assurance practices such as reliability monitoring programs for qualification and lot-to-lot controls.

C.2 Definition of Terms 

Arrayed Wave Guide A specific type of multiplexer/demultiplexer fabricated on a chip (a Planar Lightwave Circuit [PLC]) with different waveguides of varying lengths to combine or separate the different channels of information carried in an optical signal. 

Burn-in The operation of a device under accelerated temperature or other stress conditions to stabilize its performance. 

Circuit Pack A printed wiring board assembly containing inserted components. Also referred to as “plug-in.” 

Component Any electrical part (e.g., integrated circuit, diode, resistor) with distinct electrical characteristics. 

Device Any electrical part (e.g., integrated circuit, diode, resistor) with distinct electrical characteristics. 

Dispersion Spreading in time when different wavelengths of light travel at different speeds within a fiber (or other optical waveguide) and so arrive at different times at the far end. 

Dispersion Compensating Module 

A module is designed to have the opposite dispersion characteristics of the fiber being compensated for, and so bring the different wavelengths back into temporal alignment. Current implementations include a spool of fiber or a grating based design. 

Distributed Feedback Laser 

A single frequency (wavelength) laser, usually a semiconductor laser, with a cavity that acts as a distributed reflector within the laser. Note that an electro-absorption modulator may be fabricated onto the same chip as a Distributed Feedback (DFB) laser. 

Early Life Factor Ratio of the early life (approximately first year) failure rate to the steady-state failure rate. 

Electro-Absorption Modulator 

Modulates the intensity of light by taking advantage of materials that cause light to be absorbed when an electric field is applied in a direction perpendicular to the waveguide. Commonly fabricated on semiconductors, an electro-absorption modulator can be fabricated on the same chip as a DFB laser. 

Error Correcting Code Code in which each data signal conforms to specific rules of construction so that departures from this construction in the received signal can generally be automatically detected and corrected. 

Failure Rate Failures in 10 9 operating hours (FITs). 

Hermetic Gas-tight enclosure that is completely sealed by fusion or other comparable means to ensure a low rate of gas leakage over a long period of time. Licensed Exclusively for Bizpeer Company Ltd. SR-332 Glossary Issue 4, March 2016 C–4 Enterprise License Restrictions. See restrictions on title page. Ericsson strictly prohibits the unauthorized distribution, download, or sale of this copyrighted material. 

Interleaver Used to combine two optical signals, each carrying multiple optical channels (wavelengths). One signal contains odd-numbered channels (according to the ITU grid), and the other contains even-numbered channels. The resulting signal contains all channels. Interleavers are often bidirectional and so could be used to de-interleave channels as well. 

Lithium Niobate Modulator 

An electrically controlled optical signal modulator (typically amplitude modulation - on/off) that works by splitting a signal into two paths and either recombining them as is to achieve full amplitude, or by delaying one path by applying an electric field to a lithium niobate waveguide and recombining the signals 180° out of phase to give zero amplitude. 

Non-hermetic Not airtight, e.g., a plastic encapsulated integrated circuit. 

Non-Serial System A system in which the failure of any unit may or may not result in the failure of the entire system. A non-serial system may have fully or partially redundant components. 

Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer 

A device multiplexes (adds) or demultiplexes (drops) one of the standard ITU Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexer ( DWDM) or Coarse WDM (CWDM) channels (wavelengths) onto or from an optical signal for transmission through a fiber. Sometimes referred to as a WDM or a wavelength coupler. 

Optical Isolator Device that permits light to travel in one direction (e.g., from input to output) but does not allow light to pass in the reverse direction (e.g., from output to input). Analogous to a diode in electronics, which allows current to pass in one direction only. 

Optical Module A small packaged assembly that includes a laser diode/LED/detector and easy means for electrical connections and optical couplings. 

Optical Switch Device that allows optical input to be passed to any one of a number of outputs, or to select from any one of a number of optical inputs to be sent to a single output. 

Planar Lightwave Circuit Optical device produced using integrated circuit manufacturing techniques to imprint optical waveguides and other related features onto a chip (e.g., silica on silicon). 

Steady-State Failure Rate 

The constant failure rate after early life (approximately one year of operation). 

Serial System A system in which the failure of any unit results in the failure of the entire system. 

System, System Level A complete assembly that performs an operational function. 

Unit, Unit Level An assembly of devices (e.g., circuit pack, module, plug-in, racks, and power supplies). Licensed Exclusively for Bizpeer Company Ltd.
